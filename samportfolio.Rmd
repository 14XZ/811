## Add any R packages you require. 
## Here are some we will use in 811:
requires <- c("tidyverse", ## tidyverse includes dplyr and ggplot2
              "magrittr",
              "foreign",
              "readstata13",
              "here")

## Install any you don't have
to_install <- c(requires %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE)
install.packages(c(requires[to_install], "NA"), repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/" )

## Load all required R packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2); theme_set(theme_minimal())
library(magrittr)
library(here)

<!-- Replace the below with bit about you. -->
### Research Interests
My focus is on Presidential elections, and more specifically on how emotions and mental health affect voting behavior. Other interests include purple state politics, correct voting, elite decision-making and state politics of Wisconsin.

### Questions I hope to answer
How does anxiety affect information processing during elections? How do anxiety and depression affect voter turnout and vote choice?

### Relevent data

- American National Election Survey

- U.S. Census


<!-- 
Sam, 
Given your interests, ANES seems like a really solid choice, but there is a lot there, so you will want to identify the items that best capture anxiety and information processing. If you need a place to start, you could grab the items used here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/03/resentful-white-people-propelled-trump-to-the-white-house-and-he-is-rewarding-their-loyalty/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.4fbcd3dd3791
When you have a list of items you want, let me know if you want help loading the ANES into R, selecting the items you want, and saving that smaller data file in your 811/data subfolder. 
Best,
Devin
